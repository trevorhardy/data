GridLAB-D's climate module supports TMY2 and CSV weather data files.

USA
---

TMY data files are combined into ZIP files by state. Extract the files
for the state you need and place them in your working folder or one of
the GridLAB-D support folders.

Canada
------

Note: As of June 2014 the Canadian TMY files are not working properly.

The data files are combined into a single ZIP file. Extract the files
and copy the ones you need to your working folder or one of the
GridLAB-D support folders.

Other Countries
---------------

You may have to search online for TMY data files for your country.
If you find TMY3 data files, try using the TMY32TMY2 conversion
utility.  You will need an ANSI "C" compiler to build the utility.
